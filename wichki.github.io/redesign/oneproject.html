  <h3>UNIO is a smartphone application that facilitates local giving and encourages enduring social interactions.</h3>

  <br>

  <p class="content">The target users are individuals and charitable organizations located in a city, whose needs and wants may change with time and context. Mindful Millennial, one of my primary personas, is a socially aware but busy individual who wants to make an impact in her local community and doesnâ€™t know how.</p><br>
  <p class="content">Residents and nonprofits can list or request specific items (like clothes, fresh produce, canned goods or household supplies) that they need. Locals who want to donate baby clothes, for example, can search for the nearest charities that needs baby clothes. Donors and charities can allocate their goods in a way that maximizes overall utility for a community.</p>

<div class="center" id="reflection">
  <h2>ðŸ’­ Reflection</h2>
  <h3>UNIO does address one key deficiency in how people currently donate and receive goods.</h3>

  <br>

  <p class="content">Based on research, there are no centralized platforms that allows nonprofit organizations to request specific items that they need, particularly for nonprofits that may lack the staff or monetary resources to maintain and update a website. Volunteer Match, which is the closest competitor in this space, matches nonprofits with volunteers based on specific volunteering needs. However, Volunteer Match does not specifically address donations. Another close competitor is Donors Choose, but this platform focuses specifically on supporting teachers and students.</p>

  <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
  <p class="content">Two aspects of my design that I am most excited about are its overall personality and the interactions afforded to donors and nonprofit organizations. Most donations are one-off interactions. UNIO unifies these two aspects in a way to help donors direct their gifts to where they can have the most impact and to create meaningful interactions. First, the design seeks to convey a light and fun mood through the use of iconography, color and voice and tone. I sought to make the donation process as seamless, frictionless and as fun as possible. Secondly, the ability to chat with a nonprofit staff member and the ability to rate an interaction could create more opportunities for a long-lasting relationship between participants by increasing the number of interactions. I believe being able to attach names to donors and nonprofits can create more human and personal connections.</p><br><br>
  <p class="content">There are some design elements I did not incorporate, primarily due to time constraints. One element would be the ability for a user to star, heart or otherwise favorite a particular nonprofit. This feature would allow users to create a list of favored organization, which she may be more inclined to donate to in the future. Another element I would have added was the ability to have nonprofits post pictures of their gifts in action. This could show donors the immediate impact of their gifts.</p>
